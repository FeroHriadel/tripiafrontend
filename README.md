```

### DEPLOYMENT
- It is assumed that there will be no stages but multiple deployments instead. Each developer can have their own deployment to play with.
- The `/deployment` folder contains aws cdk code to deploy the frontend app on AWS Amplify. It is currently set up to deploy the code from the `main` branch under the app name: `devTripiaFrontend`. Please change these 2 if you need to have a deployment from another branch: `/deployment/lib/deployment-stack.ts` has detailed instructions on how to do that.
<br />
- Create a github token in github - like this:
<br />
<small>
  go to your Github / click ur profile picture (right up) / Settings
  (left sidebar) Developer Settings / Personal Access Tokens / Tokens (classic)
  Generate new token / choose classic / Select scopes: repo & admin:repo_hook / name it e.g.: `github-token` / Generate token
  Copy the value of the token (something like: `ghp_66PWc461Drgh0nvEFiiKnsabzPJtZf2583Wq`)
</small>
- Put the github token in AWS / SECRETS MANAGER under the name `github-token` like this:
<br />
<small>
  copy the value of the github-token and go to AWS / SECRETS MANAGER / Store a new secret / Other type of secret / Next
  in Key/value pair section click Plaintext tab and paste the github-token there / Next / Secret name: github-token / Next / complete the procedureâ€¦
</small>
- go to frontend folder and run $ `npm run build`. See if it builds properly. Fix if not.
- go to frontend/tsconfig.json and add "deployment" to the "exclude" array (if not already there)
```
"exclude": ["node_modules", "cdk.out", "deployment"]
```
- Go to frontend/deployment and create a new file: .env.
- Fill it out with values that are true for you:
```
